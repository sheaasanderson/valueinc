# Sales Analysis for Value Inc.

I'd like to run an sales analysis for Value Inc to facilitate a macro view of the overall sales. I'll perform some basic transformation in order to provide relevant sales metrics such as cost per transaction, cost per item, markup, etc.

## Description

Value Inc is a retail store that sells household items all over the world in bulk.

The Sales Manager has no sales reporting but he has a brief idea of current sales. He also has no idea of the monthly cost, profit, or top selling products. He wants a dashboard on this and says the data is currently stored in an excel file.
